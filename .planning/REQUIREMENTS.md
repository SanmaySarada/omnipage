# Requirements: Omni Card Landing Page

**Defined:** 2025-01-31

- [x] **NAV-02**: Mobile hamburger menu with slide-out navigation
- [x] **NAV-03**: Magnetic hover effect on CTA button (cursor-aware pull)
- [x] **NAV-04**: Smooth scroll to sections on nav link click

### Hero

- [ ] **HERO-01**: 3D interactive card (React Three Fiber) with cursor-reactive tilt and rotation

### How It Works

- [ ] **HIW-01**: Scroll-linked animation section (150-200vh, not a marathon)
- [ ] **HIW-02**: Animated payment flow: card swipe → particles along SVG path → split to ACH (school) + rewards (user)

- [ ] **HIW-04**: Static step cards fallback for prefers-reduced-motion

### Audience Tabs

- [ ] **AUD-01**: Tab switcher with sliding underline indicator
- [ ] **AUD-02**: Students & Parents tab: rewards on tuition, better loan rates, 3x-10x merchant points, discovery, proximity notifications

### Feature Grid

### Interactive Calculator

- [ ] **CALC-03**: Odometer-style animated counters for points and dollar value
- [ ] **CALC-04**: Output: total points, estimated value ($), effective tuition reduction (%)
- [ ] **CALC-05**: CTA below calculator → waitlist

### Discovery Preview

- [ ] **DISC-01**: App mockup showing map UI with nearby merchant markers
- [ ] **DISC-02**: Preview of proximity notification ("You're near Campus Coffee — earn 5x points today")

### FAQ

- [ ] **FAQ-01**: Accordion with smooth height animation (Framer Motion layout)

### Final CTA

### Footer

- [x] **FOOT-01**: Logo, nav links, legal placeholders (Privacy, Terms)

### Cross-Cutting
