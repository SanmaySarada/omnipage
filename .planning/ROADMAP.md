# Roadmap

**Project:** Omni Card Landing Page
**Created:** 2025-01-31
**Phases:** 10

## Overview

This roadmap derives 10 phases from the 35 v1 requirements, respecting the architecture research's dependency graph: design tokens feed Tailwind which enables shadcn/ui; animation infrastructure precedes 3D; 3D infrastructure precedes the card; scroll section requires both. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability that unblocks subsequent work.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Project infrastructure is in place with design system tokens ready for all components
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements:** CORE-01, CORE-02

**Success Criteria:**
1. Next.js app renders with correct fonts and metadata
2. Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows) are defined in CSS variables
3. Tailwind config extends tokens correctly (classes like `bg-primary` work)
4. shadcn/ui is initialized and a test component (Button) renders with correct styling

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Next.js project with Tailwind v4 and design tokens
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — shadcn/ui integration and Button verification

### Phase 2: Layout Components

**Goal:** Navigation and footer provide consistent page structure across all viewports
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Requirements:** NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03, NAV-04, FOOT-01, FOOT-02

**Success Criteria:**
1. User sees sticky navigation with logo, section links, and "Join Waitlist" CTA on scroll
2. User can tap hamburger on mobile and navigate via slide-out menu
3. User observes magnetic hover effect when cursor approaches CTA button
4. User clicks nav link and page smoothly scrolls to target section
5. User sees footer with logo, nav links, legal placeholders, and social icons

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Dependencies and animation infrastructure (motion, shadcn Sheet, hooks)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Navigation components (Magnetic, MobileNav, HeaderNav, Header)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Footer components (FooterSocials, Footer)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Layout integration and visual verification
