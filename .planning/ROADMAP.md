# Roadmap

**Project:** Omni Card Landing Page
**Created:** 2025-01-31
**Phases:** 10

## Overview

This roadmap derives 10 phases from the 35 v1 requirements, respecting the architecture research's dependency graph: design tokens feed Tailwind which enables shadcn/ui; animation infrastructure precedes 3D; 3D infrastructure precedes the card; scroll section requires both. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability that unblocks subsequent work.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Project infrastructure is in place with design system tokens ready for all components
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements:** CORE-01, CORE-02

**Success Criteria:**
1. Next.js app renders with correct fonts and metadata
2. Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows) are defined in CSS variables
3. Tailwind config extends tokens correctly (classes like `bg-primary` work)
4. shadcn/ui is initialized and a test component (Button) renders with correct styling

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Next.js project with Tailwind v4 and design tokens
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — shadcn/ui integration and Button verification

### Phase 7.1: Professional Illustrations (SUPERSEDED by 7.2)
