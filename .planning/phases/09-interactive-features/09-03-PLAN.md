  <name>Task 1: Update page.tsx with Calculator and FAQ sections</name>
  <files>
    app/page.tsx
    components/content-sections/index.ts
  </files>
  <action>
1. Update `components/content-sections/index.ts` to include new exports:
   ```typescript
   export { FeatureGrid } from './feature-grid'
   export { AudienceTabs } from './audience-tabs'
   export { DiscoveryPreview } from './discovery-preview'
   export { CalculatorSection } from '../calculator'
   export { FAQSection } from '../faq'
   export { SecurityAccordion } from '../security'
   ```

2. Update `app/page.tsx`:
   - Import CalculatorSection from '@/components/calculator'
   - Import FAQSection from '@/components/faq'
   - Import SecurityAccordion from '@/components/security'

   Section order (per 08-04 decision):
   1. HeroSection
   2. HowYouEarnSection
   3. CalculatorSection (replaces placeholder)
   4. AudienceTabs
   5. FeatureGrid (if present)
   6. DiscoveryPreview (if present)
   7. FAQSection with SecurityAccordion (replaces placeholder)

   For FAQ section integration, update FAQSection or wrap in a container that includes SecurityAccordion below the FAQ:
   ```tsx
   {/* FAQ Section with Security */}
   <FAQSection />
   <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 pb-20">
     <SecurityAccordion />
   </section>
   ```

3. Remove placeholder sections:
   - Delete the calculator placeholder `<section id="calculator">...</section>`
   - Delete the FAQ placeholder `<section id="faq">...</section>`
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - `npm run build` passes
    - No placeholder sections remain in page.tsx
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Calculator section integrated in correct position
    - FAQ section integrated with SecurityAccordion
    - All placeholder sections removed
    - Barrel exports updated
  </done>
