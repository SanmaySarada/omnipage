# Phase 7.2 Plan 01: Remove Storyset Illustrations & Restore Refined Isometric Shapes Summary

**Replaced Storyset cartoon illustrations with clean geometric isometric building SVGs for professional fintech aesthetic**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-03T08:08:43Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-03T08:13:43Z
- **Tasks:** 6
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Deleted ~730KB of Storyset cartoon illustration files (bank.svg, campus.svg, university.svg)
- Created clean geometric isometric bank with classical facade, columns, pediment, and dollar sign emblem
- Created clean geometric isometric university with central tower, spire, flag, and symmetric wings
- Created clean geometric isometric campus building for map center placement
- All scroll-linked animations preserved (opacity, y, scale transforms)
- Build passes successfully

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Delete Storyset illustration files** - Files were never in git (not committed to repository)
2. **Task 2: Restore IsometricBank** - `8df4d41` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Restore IsometricSchool** - `5372f9a` (feat)
4. **Task 4: Restore CampusBuilding** - `01412fd` (feat)
5. **Task 5: Review ISO_COLORS** - No changes needed (colors appropriate for depth)
6. **Task 6: Verify visual output** - Build verification passed

## Files Created/Modified

- `components/how-you-earn/tuition-rewards/isometric-bank.tsx` - Replaced Image with geometric SVG bank
- `components/how-you-earn/tuition-rewards/isometric-school.tsx` - Replaced Image with geometric SVG university
- `components/how-you-earn/discover-rewards/campus-building.tsx` - Replaced Image with geometric SVG campus

## Decisions Made

- **Geometric SVGs over external files** - Inline SVGs use ISO_COLORS directly for consistent theming
- **Classical bank facade** - Columns, pediment, steps, and dollar sign emblem for institutional feel
- **University with symmetric wings** - Central tower with spire creates landmark appearance
- **Window grids via array map** - Clean code pattern for repeated isometric parallelogram windows
- **ISO_COLORS unchanged** - Current palette creates proper depth, no adjustments needed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **Storyset files not in git** - The illustration files in `public/illustrations/buildings/` were never committed to the repository. Deletion from filesystem was successful but no git commit needed for Task 1.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Geometric isometric buildings ready for typography and color refinements in 07.2-02, 07.2-03
- All scroll animations intact and working
- Build verification passed
