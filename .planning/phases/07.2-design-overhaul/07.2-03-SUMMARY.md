# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-foundation
    provides: OKLCH color format, CSS custom properties
provides:
  - Refined primary color palette (0.45 0.16 270)
  - Subtle hero gradient (3 stops, 30s animation)
  - Coordinated ISO_COLORS for illustrations
affects: [all-ui-components, hero-section, how-you-earn-illustrations]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Lower saturation (0.16) for premium fintech aesthetic"
    - "Lighter hero gradients (0.01-0.02 saturation)"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - app/globals.css
    - components/how-you-earn/shared/constants.ts

key-decisions:
  - "Primary saturation 0.16 (from 0.22) - more refined, still visible"
  - "Primary lightness 0.45 (from 0.50) - deeper for sophistication"
  - "Hero gradient 3 stops (from 5) - simpler, cleaner"

patterns-established:
  - "Color refinement: reduce saturation for fintech maturity"
  - "Gradient simplification: fewer stops, lower saturation"

# Phase 7.2 Plan 03: Color Palette Refinement Summary

**Reduced primary saturation from 0.22 to 0.16 and simplified hero gradient for sophisticated fintech aesthetic**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-03T08:08:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-03T08:12:00Z
- **Tasks:** 6
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Primary color refined: oklch(0.45 0.16 270) - deeper and less saturated
- Ring and chart-1 colors synchronized with primary
- Hero gradient simplified: 3 stops, 200% size, 30s animation
- ISO_COLORS updated to match across all illustration components

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Tasks 1-3: Primary, ring, chart-1 colors** - `9e749fd` (style)
2. **Task 4: Hero gradient simplification** - `132a44e` (style)
3. **Task 5: ISO_COLORS update** - `de9319e` (style)
4. **Task 6: Build verification** - (verification only, no commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/globals.css` - Updated --primary, --ring, --chart-1, .hero-gradient
- `components/how-you-earn/shared/constants.ts` - Updated ISO_COLORS primary variants and books merchant

## Decisions Made

1. **Saturation 0.16 chosen** - Based on competitive analysis (Mercury ~0.18, Bilt near-zero). Balances sophistication with brand presence.
2. **Lightness 0.45** - Darker provides depth while maintaining WCAG AA contrast with white foreground (0.99).
3. **Hero gradient 3 stops** - Fewer stops = less visual noise. Slower animation (30s) feels more premium.
4. **Books merchant updated** - Was using old primary value, coordinated for consistency.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Updated books merchant color in ISO_COLORS**
- **Found during:** Task 5 (ISO_COLORS update)
- **Issue:** books merchant color was using old primary value oklch(0.50 0.22 270)
- **Fix:** Updated to match new primary oklch(0.45 0.16 270)
- **Files modified:** components/how-you-earn/shared/constants.ts
- **Verification:** Grep confirmed no remaining references to old value
- **Committed in:** de9319e (Task 5 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 missing critical)
**Impact on plan:** Essential for color consistency. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks completed as planned.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Color palette refinement complete
- Ready for 07.2-04 (Final Polish and Verification)
- All primary-based colors now use consistent oklch(0.45 0.16 270)
