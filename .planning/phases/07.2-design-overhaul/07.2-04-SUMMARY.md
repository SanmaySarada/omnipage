# Phase 7.2 Plan 04: Component Styling & Spacing Refinement Summary

**Reduced border radius to 8px, added multi-layer shadow system, increased padding across components for premium fintech density**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-03T08:13:12Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-03T08:15:12Z
- **Tasks:** 8
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Reduced base border radius from 10px to 8px for cleaner edges
- Implemented 4-level shadow depth system (sm, md, lg, xl) with multi-layer values
- Increased padding across hero, metric cards, points badge, and tuition card
- Added shadow hover effect to primary buttons for interactive feedback
- Refined border opacity for subtle card edges

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Reduce base border radius** - `052b558` (style)
2. **Task 2: Improve shadow depth system** - `38ae779` (style)
3. **Task 3: Refine metric cards** - `362a6cf` (style)
4. **Task 4: Increase hero whitespace** - `b68b23e` (style)
5. **Task 5: Refine button hover states** - `2d2b004` (style)
6. **Task 6: Refine points badge** - `89de793` (style)
7. **Task 7: Refine tuition card** - `d616b0a` (style)
8. **Task 8: Verify styling changes** - build passed

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/globals.css` - Reduced radius, improved shadow system with xl level
- `components/ui/button.tsx` - Added shadow-sm and hover:shadow-md to default variant
- `components/hero/metric-cards.tsx` - Increased padding p-6 to p-8, shadow-sm to shadow-md
- `components/hero/hero-section.tsx` - Increased vertical padding py-20 to py-24 lg:py-32
- `components/how-you-earn/rewards-loop/points-badge.tsx` - Increased padding p-6 md:p-8 to p-8 md:p-10
- `components/how-you-earn/rewards-loop/tuition-card.tsx` - Increased padding, subtle border opacity, refined shadow

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 8px base radius (0.5rem) | Matches Bilt/Mercury fintech standards, cleaner than 10px |
| 4-level shadow system | sm for subtle, md for elevated, lg for cards, xl for modals |
| Multi-layer shadow values | More realistic depth perception with blur + ambient |
| Shadow hover on buttons | Interactive feedback beyond opacity, feels premium |
| p-8/p-10 standard | Generous padding matches premium fintech density |
| Border 50-70% opacity | Subtle edges don't compete with shadow depth |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all styling changes compiled successfully.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 7.2 Design Overhaul is now COMPLETE with all 4 plans finished:
- 07.2-01: Geometric SVG illustrations
- 07.2-02: Typography system with Geist
- 07.2-03: Color palette refinement
- 07.2-04: Component styling & spacing

The design system now reflects a mature fintech aesthetic with:
- Refined typography (Geist + Inter pairing)
- Sophisticated colors (reduced saturation, deeper primary)
- Clean geometry (8px radius, multi-layer shadows)
- Premium density (generous whitespace throughout)

Ready for Phase 8 or production review.
