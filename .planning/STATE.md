# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** Visitors immediately understand that Omni unlocks rewards on tuition without costing schools anything - and trust the page enough to join the waitlist.
**Current focus:** Phase 9 - Calculator and FAQ sections

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 10 (Interactive Features)
Plan: 2 of 3 plans complete (09-01, 09-02)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-03 - Completed 09-01 Calculator Section

Progress: [========================] ~85% (09-01, 09-02 complete, 09-03 pending)

**Note:** Phase 7.1 (Storyset illustrations) was attempted but SUPERSEDED. The Storyset illustrations contained cartoon characters and playful elements inappropriate for fintech. Phase 7.2 addresses this comprehensively.

## Phase 7 Redesign

**Why:** Original implementation didn't reflect actual product model. Omni has THREE earning streams, not one payment flow.

**New Structure (4 full-width sections):**
1. **Tuition Rewards** — Bank -> ACH -> School -> $250 rewards (isometric) COMPLETE
2. **Unlock Rate** — Progress gauge, 20%->0.5%, 40%->1.0% thresholds COMPLETE
3. **Discover Rewards** — Isometric campus map, merchant pins 3x-10x COMPLETE
4. **Rewards Loop** — Points combine, reduce next tuition, cycle repeats COMPLETE

**Plans:**
- 07-05: Cleanup old implementation + new infrastructure COMPLETE
- 07-06: Tuition Rewards section COMPLETE
- 07-07: Unlock Rate section COMPLETE
- 07-08: Discover Rewards section COMPLETE
- 07-09: Rewards Loop section COMPLETE

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 17 (v1) + 5 (v2) = 22
- Phase 7 v2 plans: 5/5 complete
